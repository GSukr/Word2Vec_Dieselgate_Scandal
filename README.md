# Word2Vec_Dieselgate_Scandal
Word2Vec model to detect words similar to "scandal" in the Twitter corpora scrapped during VW dieselgate scandal.

The ancillary goal of the project on Volkswagen emission scandal was to find the way to detect corporate scandals. Word2Vec model implemented with Gensim Library helps us find the words that are contexually close to the word "scandal" in the corpora of 1.5 mlt tweets scrapped during 6 months after the scandal unfolded.
